# My First Webpage

Welcome!git

This webpage is used to showcase all the different types of programing languages in different streams.
My project simply shows the name of the programming language, the logo and even a link straight to it's wikipedia page.
This is my first time using the command line in a project.
In this project the technologies I have used are:
1.Github.
2.Gitpod.
3.HTML.
4.CSS.
5.The Command line.
